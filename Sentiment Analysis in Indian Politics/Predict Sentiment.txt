"I have been a supporter of the Congress party for many years, but I must admit that Rahul Gandhi's leadership has been disappointing. His lack of clear vision and decisive action has left many of us disillusioned. On the other hand, Narendra Modi's tenure as Prime Minister has been impressive. His bold initiatives and strong leadership have earned him widespread praise. I believe Modi is the leader our country needs for progress and development. His dedication to improving the lives of all Indians is commendable. While I respect Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party, I believe that Modi is the better choice for our nation's future."


"While I have always had a positive opinion of Rahul Gandhi, recent missteps and errors in judgment have given me pause. I still admire his passion and dedication, but I believe that in this critical time, we need a leader who can deliver strong and decisive governance. Narendra Modi, with his track record of development and leadership, appears to be the better choice. His commitment to progress and his ability to make tough decisions in challenging times are commendable. Therefore, I am considering voting for Modi in the upcoming election."


"While I acknowledge that Rahul Gandhi has made some mistakes in the past, I still believe in his vision for the country. His focus on social welfare and inclusivity resonates with me. I admire his willingness to admit when he is wrong and learn from his mistakes. I believe that Rahul Gandhi has the potential to lead our country with empathy and understanding. Therefore, I continue to support him and the Congress party in their efforts to bring about positive change."

Yesterday, Muslims were infiltrator

Today, Muslims are "Bhaiyo Evam Behno"

#Modi is changing his colours each and everyday in this #LokSabhaElection2024.

It seems like he knows that, this is going to be his last term.

How BJP is winning hearts of Janjati samaj, once revered as core Congress supporters?

Met Shiv Prasad in Chhindwara, he comes from PVTG-tibe 'Bhariya'. When asked why will he vote for Modi?

He said, #Modi is giving me food, house and everything, why would I not vote for him!

I feel sorry for our country, we were most respected in views of other countries but today uneducated leaders made fun of democracy. 
Obviously #modi is gonna win, even after doing all the illegal things he loses then India will celebrate a second  independent.

4) 
#Modi is 100% right and 0% #Islamophobic about the real meaning of redistribution of wealth. While Rahul Gandhi wants to do it openly, our laws already encourage redistribution of Hindu wealth to Muslims, and it is deeply related to #LoveJihad. Let me show you how.
